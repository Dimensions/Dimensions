# Dimensions
The implementation of Portal into the Minecraft server. 

##What is this?
Dimensions is a Minecraft server mod that implements Portal, a fork of the Bukkit API.
###Isn't that how Bukkit died?
Bukkit's death had *absolutely nothing* to do with them modifying Minecraft.

##Bukkit Plugins?
Plugins written in Bukkit will work on Dimensions, unless they contain NMS or OCB code. 

There will also be a lot more events to hook into the Packet System, as Packets will be able to be controlled using Events.

##Spigot Plugins?
Support for Spigot plugins may come soon, but is not intended at this time.

##Sponge Support?
No Sponge plugin support is planned as of now.

##Can I write Plugins in other languages?
This will be one of the major differences between Bukkit, Spigot, Glowstone, & Trident. Dimensions will have official support for a variety of languages, but the main one will be Java.

##Will this be faster than Sponge/Spigot/Trident?
Probably not, I'm not worried about performance that much right now. This may change later down the line, when more is done.
