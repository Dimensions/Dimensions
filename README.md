##What is this?
Dimensions is a Minecraft server mod that allows people to create plugins that can completely modify the way Minecraft works.

##How does it work?
There are two parts to Dimensions, the *indirect implementation* and the *direct implementation*. The *indirect* is the Java source code for Dimensions, implementing the API. The *direct* is a group of patches for the vanilla Minecraft server. Using these, we can comepltely open source Dimensions without open sourcing Minecraft.

##Can I write Plugins in other languages?
This will be one of the major differences between Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, & Trident. Dimensions will have official support for a variety of languages, but the main one will be Java.

##Will this be faster than Sponge/Spigot/Trident?
Probably not, I'm not worried about performance that much right now. This may change later down the line, when more is done.
