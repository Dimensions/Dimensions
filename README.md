# Dimensions
The implementation of Portal into the Minecraft server. 

Bukkit Plugins?
---------------
Plugins written in Bukkit will work on Dimensions, unless they contain NMS or OCB code. 

There will also be a lot more events to hook into the Packet System, as Packets will be able to be controlled using Events.

Spigot Plugins?
---------------
Support for Spigot plugins may come soon, but is not intended at this time.

Sponge Support?
---------------

Can I write Plugins in other languages?
--------------------------------------
This will be one of the major differences between Bukkit, Spigot, Glowstone, & Trident. Dimensions will have official support for a variety of languages, but the main one will be Java.

Will this be faster than Sponge/Spigot/Trident?
------------------------------------------------------
Probably not, I'm not worried about performance that much right now. This may change later down the line, when more is done.
